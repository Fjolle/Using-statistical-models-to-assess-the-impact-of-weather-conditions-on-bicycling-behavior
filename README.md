# **Overview

Bike sharing systems have ploriferated in cities around the world as one of the most innovative transport modes. These digital bike-sharing platforms powered by modern technologies have found use particularly by the millenials who are increasingly more aware of the environment and health,  tech-savy, and in demand of instant gratification. The city of London has one of the largest digital bike-sharing systems in the World known as Santander bikes with 783 docking stations as of 2019 and 10 million annual bike trips. Transport for London (TfL) has made data on all public transport modes, including digital bike-sharing open through an API. In the following, I will use the bike-jouney data in conjuction with weather data to analyze, vizualize and provide insights on bike journeys in London throughout 2019 and analyze the impact of weather on the use of the London bikeshare system.
